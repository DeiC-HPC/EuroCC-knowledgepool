This project aimed to investigate the mapping between prehistoric rock art images and their meaning. Due to the inherently three-dimensional nature of rock art the required image processing can require a lot of computing power. By outsourcing the image processing to an HPC facility the researchers were able to obtain results while in the field without the need to carry extra computing equipment to the site, and make decisions based on the processed data. In this way HPC enables greater flexibility during field work by reducing the barrier of image processing time without the need for extra equipment on site.

The goal of this project was to study economical patterns in the eastern Roman Empire by combining economical models with archaeological data. A great challenge to such a project is parameter estimation due to the lack of input data. In order to accurately fit a sufficiently complex model to the available data a vast parameter space has to be explored. This requires a large number of model simulations necessitating advanced computational resources. HPC thus enabled the researchers to study the economic patterns of an ancient society using archaeological data.

## DaCy â€“ A Unified Framework for Danish natural language processing (NLP)

Natural language processing (NLP), such as recognition of names for anonymization or detecting hate speech on the internet has in recent years seen considerable improvements, however only a few Danish models exist and they use different underlying frameworks. Using UCloud DaCy has been developed which besides integrating existing models also include multiple new models for syntactical analysis and named entity recognition that obtain state-of-the-art performance for these tasks.

The use of UCloud allowed the project to quickly scale up from a few initial models to larger models leading to noticeable performance increases obtaining a step change on tasks such as dependency parsing, which for example can be used to determine who or what an adjective describes. Similarly using UCloud made it easy to include multiple collaborators to the project allowing for future projects without the need to create an infrastructure for secure file management.
