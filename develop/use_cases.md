This project investigated the mapping between prehistoric rock art images and their meaning. Due to the inherently three-dimensional nature of rock art, the required image processing can require a lot of computing power. By outsourcing the image processing to an HPC facility, the researchers could obtain results while in the field without the need to carry extra computing equipment to the site and make decisions based on the processed data. In this way, HPC enables greater flexibility during fieldwork by reducing the barrier of image processing time without the need for extra equipment on site.

This project studied economic patterns in the Eastern Roman Empire by combining economic models with archaeological data. A significant challenge in such a project is parameter estimation due to the lack of input data. A vast parameter space has to be explored to accurately fit a sufficiently complex model to the available data. This requires a large number of model simulations necessitating advanced computational resources. HPC thus enabled the researchers to study the economic patterns of an ancient society using archaeological data.

## DaCy – A Unified Framework for Danish natural language processing (NLP)

Natural language processing (NLP), such as recognizing names for anonymization or detecting hate speech on the internet, has seen considerable improvements in recent years; however, only a few Danish models exist, and they use different underlying frameworks. Using UCloud, DaCy has been developed, which besides integrating existing models, also includes multiple new models for syntactical analysis and named entity recognition that obtain state-of-the-art performance for these tasks.

The use of UCloud allowed the project to quickly scale up from a few initial models to larger models. This led to noticeable performance increases and obtaining a step change on tasks such as dependency parsing, which can determine who or what an adjective describes. Similarly, using UCloud made it easy to include multiple collaborators in the project, allowing for future projects without creating an infrastructure for secure file management.

## The Danish Blood Donor Study (DBDS) genomic cohort.
<!---### Affiliations: KU, AU, CBS, AUH, KUH, OUH, RUH -->

The DBDS genomic cohort is a comprehensive catalog for large-scale genetic analyses concerning numerous environmental and lifestyle factors affecting donors' health. The study includes data from more than 100.000 donors. It has assessed quality measures such as kinship, ethnicity, and minor allele frequency. The study makes continuous assessments of the donors, resulting in large amounts of data collected and processed using HPC. The use of HPC allows for simultaneously testing multiple hypotheses and dynamical scaling.

## Conspicuous consumption in the United States and China
<!---### Affiliation: Copenhagen Business School -->
<!---### Researcher: [David Jinkins, Copenhagen Business School](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-economics/staff/djeco) --->

Conspicuous consumption describes and explains the consumer practice of buying and using goods of higher quality, price, or greater quantity than practical. This study considered differences in conspicuous consumption in the United States and China. The paper uses a partial-equilibrium, heterogeneous-agent structural model, where the consumer's peer infers the consumer's wealth based on their purchases. The model was simulated and shown to produce data similar to the observed data using HPC. Simulations were also used to estimate welfare gains of sales taxes on various consumer goods.

### XPEROHS - Expression and Persiving Online Hate Speech
<!---### Affiliation: University of Southern Denmark -->

The XPEROHS-project aims to investigate online hate speech. Its finding involves the semantics and pragmatics of denigration, the covert dynamics of hate speech, perceptions of spoken and written hate speech, and rhetorical hate speech strategies employed in online interaction. The project uses data from large-scale Facebook and Twitter corpora, yielding corpus sizes of hundreds of millions. These enormous amounts of data make linguistic annotation extremely challenging. Therefore, it is essential to the project that this annotation can be performed on HPC clusters rather than laptops.
